# parso

A parser combinator written from scratch in order to learn more about parsers,
and written inspired by [injuly's example](https://github.com/srijan-paul/mini-angstrom)
using [Effect](https://effect.website/docs/quickstart) and Typescript.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run src/index.ts
```

To run the tests:

```bash
bun run test
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.21. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
