![Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/sagnikc395/parso/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)


A parser combinator library written from scratch in order to learn more about parsers,
and written inspired by [injuly's example](https://github.com/srijan-paul/mini-angstrom)
using Python.

## Examples

run `main.py` for a simple JSON parser and its output.
